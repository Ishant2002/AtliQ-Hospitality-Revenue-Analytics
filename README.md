# AtliQ-Hospitality-Revenue-Analytics
## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.
## Objective
To analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as RevPAR, ADR, occupancy rates to identify trends, insights, and opportunities for improvement. This analysis will inform strategic decision-making to enhance competitiveness and profitability in the market.
## Key Metrics
* __RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)__: This metric indicates the hotel's ability to generate revenue from its available rooms and is calculated by dividing total room revenue by the total number of available rooms.
* __ADR (Average Daily Rate)__: ADR represents the average rate at which rooms are sold and is calculated by dividing total room revenue by the total number of rooms sold (occupied rooms).
* __Occupancy Rate__: This metric measures the percentage of available rooms that are occupied and is calculated by dividing the number of occupied rooms by the total number of available rooms.
* __Cancellation %__ : Cancellation percentage is a key metric in the hospitality industry that measures the percentage of bookings that are canceled. 
* __Realization %__ : The realization percentage is a metric used in the hospitality industry to measure the percentage of potential revenue that is actually realized. A higher realization percentage indicates that the hotel is effectively maximizing its revenue opportunities.
## Key Features
* __Real-time Data Updates__: This dashboard will provide real-time updates on key metrics, allowing stakeholders to make timely decisions.
* __Drill-down Capability__: Users will be able to drill down into specific data points to understand underlying trends and patterns.

## Insights
* Mumbai generates the highest revenue followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi.
* AtliQ Blu has the highest occupancy of 62%.
* Week 32 recorded the lowest revenue among all, which is 21 Million.
* Delhi has the most occupancy rate as well as the average rating.
* AtliQ Exortica generates highest revenue.
* ADR remains constant, even on weekends and during peak seasons, suggesting a lack of dynamic pricing strategy.
* Direct offline bookings have the highest ADR, implying online platforms may offer discounts.
* Despite high ADR, hotels have average ratings below 3, indicating potential discrepancies in customer expectations.
* Lowering ADR could increase successful booking rates by aligning with perceived value.
* Hotels in Hyderabad have good average ratings but low ADR (<10,000).
* Bangalore has the lowest occupancy rate but is the 2nd highest revenue contributor.
* The Elite category leads in revenue and is 2nd highest in occupancy.
* Cancellation rate, consistently around 24-25%, is not a key performance indicator. Check this with the market trends and take actions accordingly.
* AtliQ should focus on increasing occupancy for revenue growth.
