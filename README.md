# AtliQ-Hospitality-Revenue-Analytics
## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.
## Objective
To analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as RevPAR, ADR, occupancy rates to identify trends, insights, and opportunities for improvement. This analysis will inform strategic decision-making to enhance competitiveness and profitability in the market.
## Key Metrics
* __RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)__: This metric indicates the hotel's ability to generate revenue from its available rooms and is calculated by dividing total room revenue by the total number of available rooms.
* __ADR (Average Daily Rate)__: ADR represents the average rate at which rooms are sold and is calculated by dividing total room revenue by the total number of rooms sold (occupied rooms).
* __Occupancy Rate__: This metric measures the percentage of available rooms that are occupied and is calculated by dividing the number of occupied rooms by the total number of available rooms.
* __Cancellation %__ : Cancellation percentage is a key metric in the hospitality industry that measures the percentage of bookings that are canceled. 
* __Realization %__ : The realization percentage is a metric used in the hospitality industry to measure the percentage of potential revenue that is actually realized. A higher realization percentage indicates that the hotel is effectively maximizing its revenue opportunities.
